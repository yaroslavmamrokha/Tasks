Task 1:
Your program is to use the brute-force approach in order to find the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. More precisely... rewrite small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the number 42. All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.

Example:

Input:

1
2
88
42
99

Output:

1
2
88

Task 2:
Peter wants to generate some prime numbers for his cryptosystem. Help him! Your task is to generate all prime numbers between two given numbers!

Input

The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t<=10). In each of the next t lines there are two numbers m and n (1 <= m <= n <= 1000000000, n-m<=100000) separated by a space.

Output

For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m <= p <= n, one number per line, test cases separated by an empty line.

Example:

Input:

2

1 10

3 5

Output:

2
3
5
7

3
5

Task 3:

Requires:
variables, data types, and numerical operators
basic input/output
logic (if statements, switch statements)

Write a program that allows the user to enter the grade scored in a programming class (0-100).
If the user scored a 100 then notify the user that they got a perfect score.

★ Modify the program so that if the user scored a 90-100 it informs the user that they scored an A

★★ Modify the program so that it will notify the user of their letter grade
0-59 F 60-69 D 70-79 C 80-89 B 90-100 A

Task 4:

Requires:
variables, data types, and numerical operators
basic input/output
logic (if statements, switch statements)

Write a program that presents the user w/ a choice of your 5 favorite beverages (Coke, Water, Sprite, ... , Whatever).
Then allow the user to choose a beverage by entering a number 1-5.
Output which beverage they chose.

★ If you program uses if statements instead of a switch statement, modify it to use a switch statement.
If instead your program uses a switch statement, modify it to use if/else-if statements.

★★ Modify the program so that if the user enters a choice other than 1-5 then it will output "Error. choice was not valid, here is your money back."

Task 5:

Requires:
variables, data types, and numerical operators
basic input/output
logic (if statements, switch statements)
loops (for, while, do-while)

Write a program that ccontinues to asks the user to enter any number other than 5 until the user enters the number 5.
Then tell the user "Hey! you weren't supposed to enter 5!" and exit the program.

★ Modify the program so that after 10 iterations if the user still hasn't entered 5 will tell the user "Wow, you're more patient then I am, you win." and exit.

★★ Modify the program so that it asks the user to enter any number other than the number equal to the number of times they've been asked to enter a number. (i.e on the first iteration "Please enter any number other than 0" and on the second iteration "Please enter any number other than 1"m etc. etc. The program must behave accordingly exiting when the user enters the number they were asked not to.)

Task 6:

Requires:
variables, data types, and numerical operators
basic input/output
logic (if statements, switch statements)
loops (for, while, do-while)
arrays

Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of pancakes eaten for breakfast by 10 different people (Person 1, Person 2, ..., Person 10)
Once the data has been entered the program must analyze the data and output which person ate the most pancakes for breakfast.

★ Modify the program so that it also outputs which person ate the least number of pancakes for breakfast.

★★★★ Modify the program so that it outputs a list in order of number of pancakes eaten of all 10 people.
i.e.
Person 4: ate 10 pancakes
Person 3: ate 7 pancakes
Person 8: ate 4 pancakes
...
Person 5: ate 0 pancakes

Task 7:

Requires:
variables, data types, and numerical operators
basic input/output
logic (if statements, switch statements)
loops (for, while, do-while)
psudo random numbers

Write a program that calculates a random number 1 through 100. The program then asks the user to guess the number.
If the user guesses too high or too low then the program should output "too high" or "too low" accordingly.
The program must let the user continue to guess until the user correctly guesses the number.

★ Modify the program to output how many guesses it took the user to correctly guess the right number.

★★ Modify the program so that instead of the user guessing a number the computer came up with, the computer guesses the number that the user has secretely decided. The user must tell the computer whether it guesed too high or too low.

★★★★ Modify the program so that no matter what number the user thinks of (1-100) the computer can guess it in 7 or less guesses.

Task 8:

Requires:
variables, data types, and numerical operators
basic input/output
logic (if statements, switch statements)
loops (for, while, do-while)
arrays

Make a two player tic tac toe game.

★ Modify the program so that it will announce when a player has won the game (and which player won, x or o)

Task 9:

Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form (Reverse Polish Notation). Two-argument operators: +, -, *, /, ^ (priority from the lowest to the highest), brackets ( ). Operands: only letters: a,b,...,z. Assume that there is only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c).

Input

t [the number of expressions <= 100]
expression [length <= 400]
[other expressions]
Text grouped in [ ] does not appear in the input file.

Output

The expressions in RPN form, one per line.
Example

Input:
3
(a+(b*c))
((a+b)*(z+x))
((a+t)*((b+(a+c))^(c+d)))

Output:
abc*+
ab+zx+*
at+bac++cd+^*

Task 10:


Recently in Farland, a country in Asia, the famous scientist Mr. Log Archeo discovered ancient pyramids. But unlike those in Egypt and Central America, they have a triangular (not rectangular) foundation. That is, they are tetrahedrons in the mathematical sense. In order to find out some important facts about the early society of the country (it is widely believed that the pyramid sizes are closely connected with Farland's ancient calendar), Mr. Archeo needs to know the volume of the pyramids. Unluckily, he has reliable data about their edge lengths only. Please, help him!

Input

t [number of tests to follow] In each of the next t lines six positive integer numbers not exceeding 1000 separated by spaces (each number is one of the edge lengths of the pyramid ABCD). The order of the edges is the following: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.

Output

For each test output a real number - the volume, printed accurate to four digits after decimal point.
